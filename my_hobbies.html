            <p class="my_hobbies_discreption">I have a diverse range of interests, including video games, basketball, programming, and cricket. I operate a YouTube channel named "Sport Ninja," where I share content related to video games, primarily focusing on EA FC and Fortnite.
                My enthusiasm for cricket started early, and I support teams such as Team India and Team USA while playing for a team called WIM. In basketball, I have been a long-time fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and have played competitively, including winning the I9 basketball league in fourth grade and representing my school in eighth and ninth grades.
                Although I engage in programming, I regard it as my least preferred hobby. Nevertheless, a key goal during my junior year of high school was to create a website, which I successfully achieved.
