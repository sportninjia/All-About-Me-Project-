        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about_me_dis">My name is Adarsh, and I have a strong passion for Computer Science and Business. Throughout my high school years, I actively participated in the STEM club during both my freshman and junior years. Additionally, I was involved in basketball, achieving league victory in the fourth grade and continuing to play during the eighth grade and my freshman year of high school. One of my key objectives prior to graduation was the development of this website.</p>
